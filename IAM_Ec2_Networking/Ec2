Elastic Cloud Compute

Ec2 is a virtual machine created on the physical server

where you can scale up and down based on demand and you only pay for what you use 
and when you stop the ec2 machine the public ip address of the machine changes which is dynamic.

If you are creating ec2 with elastic Ip address then if you stop the machine also Ip will not be changed.
