Git is a version control tool which tracks your changes especially code.
GitHub is a website/service that stores Git repositories online. So that you can work as team.

To Start with Git

If you are in windows

1. Goto official Git page and download package and install it

If you are in Mac

1. brew install git

2. git --version
-- Check for Git Version

3. git config --global user.name "your name"
   git config --global user.email "your email"
-- Set your identity it uses for your commits

4. git config --list
-- To check list

5. git init
-- It initializes the git in the folder you ran

6. git add . - To add all files 
   git add <file_name> or git add -u <PATH>
-- To add all files from your working directory to staging area

7. git commit -m "comment"
-- To add your file from staging area to local repository

8. git remote add origin https://github.com/username/folder
-- For the inital push to GitHub our local git need to understand where to push 
for that we need to create one folder in GitHub and add that path and run the command

9. git push -u origin main
-- So that changes are pushed to main branch of git hub

10. git pull origin main
   [ It is combination of git fetch --downloads the latest changes from remote& git merge --It merges them into your current branch]
-- To pull the latest changes from GitHub to local repository Git

Scenario 1 - If dev1 and dev2 are working on the same file where dev1 downloaded the file from git and done the changes and commited the code at the same time dev2 changed the same file when they try to pull the changes and git will not understand what changes to keep and it creates a merge conflict.

the run below 

11. git config pull.rebase true

12. Goto conflicted file keep what required and if both are required then keep both

<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
their changes
>>>>>>> feature-branch

then remove the special characters and run

13. git rebase --continue
--  It shows if there are still conflicts If no changes to do then come out of the file

14. git push
-- It reolves the conflict

15. git branch
-- Currently you are pointed to which branch

16. git branch -M <BRANCH_NAME>
-- To change branch Name

17. git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>
--  To switch to that branch

18. git branch <BRANCH_NAME>
-- To create the branch

19. git checkout <commit number> --<PATH>
-- It will restore the file

20. git reflog
-- It provides the details of commits deleted also

21. touch .gitignore
-- Add the folder name example .terraform which has more space so GitHub will not allow add that .terraform/ so all the files inside that are ignored when you do git add .
